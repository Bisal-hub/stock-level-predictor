#To use this module, you would need to provide the path to your stock data CSV file, as well as the name of the target variable column. You would need to preprocess the data and perform any necessary feature engineering before training the model.

#One example to use this module is given below:

# Create an instance of the StockPredictor class
predictor = StockPredictor(data_path='stock_data.csv')

# Load the data
predictor.load_data()

# Train the model
predictor.train_model()

# Evaluate the model
predictor.evaluate_model()

# Make predictions
features = ...  # Provide the features for prediction
predictions = predictor.predict(features)
print('Predictions:', predictions)
